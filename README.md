# POC
Proof of Concept
Title: Built a supervised AI model to predict the count of sale in a bike rending online platform.

Tools Used: Machine learning, Supervised AI, Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Sick it-learn, Linear regression, Statistics.

Description: 

•	The data collection team performed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and deposited the data as CSV files in the source folder.
•	I conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover underlying numeric trends within the domain. 
•	I constructed a Multilinear Regression model to predict the target variable. The model was evaluated using metrics such as MAE (Mean Absolute Error), MSE (Mean Squared Error), and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
•	To enhance model comprehension, I identified outliers and refined the predictions for the target variable, ultimately achieving a final score.
